                `Consistent Hashing`,
                `- Type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when a hash table get resized. - Often used by load balancers to distribute traffic to servers. - It minimizes the number of requests that get forwarded to diff. servers when new servers are added or when existing are down.`,

                `Randezvoues Hashing`,
                `- Type of hashing also called highest random weight hashing. - Allows for minimal re-distribution of mappings when a server down.`,

                `Key-Value Store`,
                `- Flexible NoSQL DB that often used for caching and dynamic configuration.`,

                `Redis`,
                `- In-Memory key-value store. - Offer persistent storage options. - Typically used as a really fast, best effort caching solution. - Also used to implement rate limiting`,

                `Etcd, ZooKeeper`,
                `- Strongly consistent and highly available key-value stores. - Used store, implement perform leader election.`,

                'Blob Storage',
                '- Widely used kind of storage, in small and large scale systems.',

                'Time Series Database',
                `- Optimized for storing and analyzing time-indexed data. - Examples are InfluxDB, Prometheus and Graphite.`

                    `Graph Database`,
                `- Stores data following graph data model. - Data entries in it can have explicitly defined relationships. - Takes advantage if their underlying graph structure to perform complex queries on deeply connected data very fast. - Are preferred dealing with systems where data points naturally form a graph and have multiple level of relationships(social networks)`,

                `Cypher`,
                `- Graph Query Language. - Originally developed for Neo4j graph DB. - Queries are simple than their SQL conuterparts.`,

                `Spatial DB`,
                `- Optimized to store data like locations on map. - Relies on spatial indexes - quadtrees to quickly perform query to find all locations in the region.`,


                `Topic Replication`,

                `Replication`,
                `- Act of duplicating the data from one DB server to other. - Used to increase redundancy of system and tolerate regional failures. - Can be used to move data closer to client, thus decreasing latency of accessing special data.`,

                `Sharding`,
                `- AKA Data Partitioning. - Act of splitting DB into 2+ pieces called - shards. - Typically done to increase the throughput of DB. - Popular strategies are: - Sharding based on client's region. - Sharding based on type to be stored(payments/user data/...) - Sharding based on hash of a column(only for structured data)`,
